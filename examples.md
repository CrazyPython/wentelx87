# Examples
Some more complex examples too long to be put in the readme.

## Loops
`0001 0000 0000 0000 0010` will loop assuming address `0000 0000` is zero and so is the current address. 
Loop body is from `0000 0010` to the current address. `0000 0010` can be changed to whatever you like.

## Output
`10001000100110001000100010001001` - output `!` once and exit

## Loops + Output
`1000100010011000100010001000100100010000000000000000` - Constantly output `!` *explanation todo*
